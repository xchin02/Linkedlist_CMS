# Linkedlist_CMS
This project is a simple Student Management System implemented in C language for me to practice and understand how linked lists work in computer memory.
This system would store each student record into a singly linked list that supports dynamically sized nodes through memory allocation.

# Features:
- SHOW ALL: Display all records
- INSERT: Insert new records
- QUERY: Display record of selected id
- UPDATE: Update record of selected id (either their programme name or marks)
- DELETE: Delete record of selected id
- SHOW SUMMARY: Displays a summary of total students, average marks, highest and lowest marks with names.
- SAVE: Save changes made
- EXIT: Exit program

# How to Compile (on Windows)
```
gcc main.c showsummary.c -o sms
.\sms
```
